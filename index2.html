		<p>As I was introduced to the Area of Inquiry project, I wondered what my idea should be. I went over many different decisions, debating tennis, learning music theory, and more ideas. But eventually, I couldn’t stop myself from wanting to make a game. It’s been a lifelong dream of mine to make a game, and I thought that now might’ve been the time. But what? But how? While it was a dream of mine, that had a double meaning. I had no idea if anything like that was feasible, much less by someone like me, in the timeframe I had. So I began to go step by step, through each major problem I thought of.</p>
